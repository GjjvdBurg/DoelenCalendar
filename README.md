DoelenCalendar
==============

DoelenCalendar is a Python module which creates an iCalendar from events in De Doelen. 
This package was created because I wanted to be able to view these events in my calendar
application. The official RSS feed of De Doelen is used to gather the events. For anyone
interested in the calendar URL, it is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2778250/doelen/doelen_calendar.ics). 
This URL is updated regularly.
